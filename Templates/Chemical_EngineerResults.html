<strong>Name: </strong>Martha Coston<br>
<strong>Date of birth: </strong>December 23, 1826<br>
<strong>Date of Death: </strong>July 9, 1904<br>
<strong>Major Accomplishments: </strong> Martha Coston was married to Benjamin Coston, a navy engineer who specialized in color coded night signals.  After his death, she came across some of his unfinished plans, and decided to pick up where he left off.  She worked tirelessly for nearly ten years before she had a break through about how to develop bright blue flairs.  She was eventually given a contract by the US Navy, who used her contracts for the Civil War.   <br>
<strong>Fun Facts:</strong> In 2006, she was inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame<br>

<strong>Name:</strong> Stephanie Kwolek <br>
<strong>Date of Birth: </strong>June 30, 1923<br>
<strong>Date of Death: </strong>June 18, 2014<br>
<strong>Major Accomplishments:</strong> In 1946, Kwolek was offered a position at DuPont because of the labor shortage with the men fighting in World War II. She originally only intended to work for a few years, but she enjoyed the work so she ended up staying.  In 1964, while searching for an alternate material to produce tires, Kwolek invented Kevlar, which is now used in over 200 applications<br>
<strong>Fun Fact: </strong>She has honorary degrees from Carnegie Mellon University, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Clarkson University<br>
